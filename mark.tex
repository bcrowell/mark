1 Ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

2 Καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἡσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ,
	«Ἰδοὺ ἀποστέλλω τὸν ἄγγελόν μου πρὸ προσώπου σου, 
	ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου·
		3 φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ 
	Ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, 
	εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ!»

4 ἐγένετο Ἰωάνης ὁ βαπτίζων ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν. 5 καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες, καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ποταμῷ ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. 6 καὶ ἦν ὁ Ἰωάνης ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσθων ἀκρίδας καὶ μέλι ἄγριον. 7 καὶ ἐκήρυσσεν λέγων, «Ἔρχεται ὁ ἰσχυρότερός μου ὀπίσω μου, οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανὸς κύψας λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ. 8 ἐγὼ ἐβάπτισα ὑμᾶς ὕδατι, αὐτὸς δὲ βαπτίσει ὑμᾶς Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ.»

\begin{translation}
1 The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

2 As it is written in the prophets,
``Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
who will prepare your way before you:
3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
`Make ready the way of the Lord!
Make his paths straight!'{}''

4 John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. 5 All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. 6 John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey. 7 He preached, saying, ``After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. 8 I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.''

9 In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10 Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 11 A voice came out of the sky, ``You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.''

12 Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. 13 He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.

14 Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God's Kingdom, 15 and saying, ``The time is fulfilled, and God's Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.''

16 Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 17 Jesus said to them, ``Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.''
18 Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.

19 Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. 20 Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.

They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. 22 They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. 23 Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 24 saying, ``Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!''

25 Jesus rebuked him, saying, ``Be quiet, and come out of him!''

26 The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. 27 They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, ``What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!'' 28 The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.

29 Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 30 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. 31 He came and took her by the hand and raised her up.

15 He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. 16 The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, ``Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?''

He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.

 13 He said to them, ``Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables? 14  The farmer sows the word. 15  The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them. 16  These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. 17  They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. 

18  Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, 19  and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 20  Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.''

21 He said to them, ``Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket  or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand? 22  For there is nothing hidden except that it should be made known, neither was anything made secret but that it should come to light. 23  If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.''

24 He said to them, ``Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and more will be given to you who hear. 25  For whoever has, to him more will be given; and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.''

26 Καὶ ἔλεγεν Οὕτως ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὡς ἄνθρωπος βάλῃ τὸν σπόρον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, 27 καὶ καθεύδῃ καὶ ἐγείρηται νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν, καὶ ὁ σπόρος βλαστᾷ καὶ μηκύνηται ὡς οὐκ οἶδεν αὐτός. 28 αὐτομάτη ἡ γῆ καρποφορεῖ, πρῶτον χόρτον, εἶτεν στάχυν, εἶτεν πλήρης σῖτος ἐν τῷ στάχυϊ. 29 ὅταν δὲ παραδοῖ ὁ καρπός, εὐθὺς ἀποστέλλει τὸ δρέπανον, ὅτι παρέστηκεν ὁ θερισμός.

 26 He said, ``God's Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, 27  and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn't know how. 28  For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 29  But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.''

30 He said, ``How will we liken God's Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? 31  It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth, 32  yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.''

33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. 34 Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.

35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, ``Let's go over to the other side.'' 36 Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. 37 A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. 38 He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, ``Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?''

39 He awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ``Peace! Be still!'' The wind ceased and there was a great calm. 40 He said to them, ``Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?''

41 They were greatly afraid and said to one another, ``Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?''
